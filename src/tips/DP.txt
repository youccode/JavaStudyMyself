        DP(Dynamic Programming)
        : method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler
        overlapping subproblems and soovling each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to
        subproblems in a table to avoid redundant computations.

        1. Top - down approach (Memoization)
        - using the recursive way, and the solutions are stored, so that the recomputaion is not happened

        2. Bottom - up approach (Tabulation)
        - solving smaller subproblems first and then using their solutions
        to build up to the solution of the original problem.

        - subproblem's solutions are stored in table.
